Hi everyone,

Welcome to Electromechanics this Fall! I’m really looking forward to meeting all of you and having a great time together as we dive into this course.

In our first class tomorrow, I’ll introduce myself, walk you through what to expect from the course, and you'll get to meet our TA.

Can’t wait to see you all there!

Cheers,


Nghia
