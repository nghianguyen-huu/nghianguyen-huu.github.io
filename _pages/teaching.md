            This course covers the principles of electromechanical energy conversion and electric motors. A review of magnetic field behavior leads to magnetic circuit calculations and permanent magnet circuit behavior. Energy balance principles are used to develop force and torque relationships for many electromechanical applications including relays, meter movements and motor operation. Basic principles of motor operation such as rotating magnetic fields, efficiency and machine ratings are given as a prelude to an in depth presentation of AC and DC motor behavior. Emphasis is placed on motor control and application.

            This course deals with the basic principles and applications of optical fiber communications. Major topics include: ray theory and electromagnetic modes in optical fiber waveguides; step-index and graded-index multimode and single-mode fibers; transmission characteristics of optical fibers such as attenuation (absorption, scattering, bending), dispersion (multipath, waveguide, material, profile), and polarization (random, preserved); optical fiber communication systems (transmitter, receiver, digital and analog system design); advanced systems; non-communications applications.

Major topics include: ray theory and electromagnetic modes in optical fiber waveguides; step-index and graded-index multimode and single-mode fibers; transmission characteristics of optical fibers such as attenuation (absorption, scattering, bending), dispersion (multipath, waveguide, material, profile), and polarization (random, preserved); optical fiber communication systems (transmitter, receiver, digital and analog system design); advanced systems; non-communications applications.

ECED 4360   Antenna Theory & Design
This class is concerned with the basic theory and design of antennas. Major topics include: potential wave equations and solutions, the concept of retarded potentials, radiation from a current element and a half-wave antenna, fundamental parameters of antennas, impedance matching and methods of excitation, antenna arrays and signal processing antennas, induction and equivalence theorems, horn and slot antennas, antenna design and measurement.

ECED 3301   Electromagnetic Waves & Propagation
This course presents the basic theory and applications of propagation of electromagnetic waves. Major topics include: time-varying Maxwell's equations, electromotive force, electromagnetic spectrum, transmission of plane waves, reflection and refraction, polarization, radiation, transmission line theory, standing wave ratio, Smith Chart, impedance matching, guided wave structures, modes and cut-off frequencies.
