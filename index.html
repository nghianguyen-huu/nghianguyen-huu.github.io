My research focuses on light-matter interactions for mechanical-opto-electronic devices, such as energy absorbers, thermophotovoltaic emitters, optical filters, and biosensors.</p> <p>With dual Master’s degrees in Mechanical Engineering, I bring extensive industry experience, including work on thin-film structures for laser strike protection, enhancements to LED roadway lighting, and acoustic systems that improve comfort in care homes. My academic journey began at <a href="https://www.insa-lyon.fr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">INSA de Lyon</a>, France, and the <a href="https://www.upc.edu/en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya</a>, Spain, where I researched MIMO-based dynamic systems for my thesis.</p> <p>My expertise spans nanophotonic structures, nanofabrication, physical studies, and sustainable energy solutions like solar absorbers, optical filters, polarizers, and biosensors. My work on wavelength-selective emitters was featured on the cover of <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0957-4484" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nanotechnology</a>. In recognition of my engineering achievements, I received the 2023 Engineering Award from Engineers Nova Scotia.</p> <p>I serve as an Associate Editor for <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/13204/editorial-board" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Applied Nanoscience</a>, Nature Springer and was previously an associate editor for the SPIE <a href="https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-nanophotonics#_=" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Journal of Nanophotonics</a>. I’ve also reviewed articles for several prestigious journals. As a senior member of SPIE, IEEE, and Optica, I contributed to the SPIE Scholarship Committee, OSA Student Chapter Excellence Prize Committee, and currently serve on the Board of Examiners and CPD Committee for Engineers Nova Scotia.</p> <p>I hold a Ph.D. in Materials Science (Photonics) and have held academic positions at Dalhousie University and Can Tho University, supported by industry experience at Metamaterial Technologies Inc., LED Roadway Lighting, and WEIR Canada. I’ve received multiple awards for best poster and oral presentations, along with travel grants from SPIE and the National Science Council of Taiwan.</p> </body></html>
